To compile and run this program, type:

gcc -o 5ps.c stat.c 5ps

Then run it using the format

./5ps -p [PID] -s -t -c -v

Where [PID] is a PID number of a process, and the options -s, -t, -c, -v are option arguments to display process state, time, the command line for the process, and the memory used.

All features are described as in the lab handout.
