To compile and run this program, type:

gcc -c 5ps.c
gcc -c stat.c
gcc -o 5ps 5ps.o stat.o

or

gcc -o 5ps.c stat.c 5ps

in a terminal, press enter,

Then run it using the format

./5ps -p [PID] -s -t -c -v

again pressing enter,

[PID] is a PID number of a process, and the options -s, -t, -c, -v are 
option arguments to display process state, time, the command line for the 
process, and the memory used.

Limitations: The program requires the corresponding fields for state, time, 
memory, and command line to be in the normal positions. Changing these
will cause the output to be incorrect.
